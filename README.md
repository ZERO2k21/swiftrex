I participated in Intel #OneApi hackathon and chose image processing as my #project title. Along with my teammates, I made a simple python app that uses tkinter, OpenCv, Deepface and os modules to detect emotions from an image of a person's face that is uploaded. The app also uses intel acceleration with the help of intel distribution for opencv and accelerates the image processing.
